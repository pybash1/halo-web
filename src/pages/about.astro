          <div class="font-satoshi text-lg leading-relaxed">
            We're Ananjan and Ritankar, two friends who decided we couldn't just
            stand by while people we care about face real safety threats every
            day.
          </div>
          <div class="font-satoshi text-lg leading-relaxed">
            After hearing too many stories from friends and family about feeling
            unsafe walking alone, dealing with harassment, or being in dangerous
            situations without help, we realized the tools out there just
            weren't cutting it. Most safety apps are clunky, unreliable when you
            need them most, or miss the mark entirely on what people actually
            need in those critical moments.
          </div>
          <div class="font-satoshi text-lg leading-relaxed">
            So we're building Halo - not as a business opportunity, but because
            we genuinely believe everyone deserves to feel safe and have real
            help when they need it. We're putting everything we've got into
            creating something that could actually make a difference for our
            community and beyond.
          </div>
          <div class="font-satoshi text-lg leading-relaxed">
            This isn't just another app for us. It's personal.
