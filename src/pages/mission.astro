            We believe safety shouldn't be a luxury or something you have to
            worry about when you're just trying to live your life.

          <div class="font-satoshi text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Our mission is simple: give people the tools they need to feel
            secure and get help fast when it matters most. Whether someone is
            walking home alone, in an unsafe relationship, or facing any threat
            to their wellbeing, they deserve more than just hoping for the best.
          </div>
          <div class="font-satoshi text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            We're building Halo to bridge that gap between feeling vulnerable
            and feeling protected. Real safety features that work when you need
            them, designed by people who actually understand what it's like to
            feel unsafe.
          </div>
          <div class="font-satoshi text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Everyone should be able to move through the world with confidence,
            knowing that help is always within reach. That's not just our goal -
            it's our responsibility.
